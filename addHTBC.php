User::createNewUser('baldonia1', 'password','anthony','baldoni',"Affectionately referred to as 'Balboni' by fellow bespectacled member Elias 'Yogi' Lozzi, Anthony is one of the club's eight founding members. He is a sophomore at NKU and majors in wearing blue shirts to the pool. He once won the election for HTBC's 'El Presidente', although his victory was controversial as he voted for himself and rival candidate Cody Howard did not. However, Baldoni randomly resigned his position, which is now vacant. In his free time, Anthony can be found working at Wendy's. Often times, his Wendy's is frequented by fellow HTBC members, who troll him by ordering meals under his middle name 'Santino.' Baldoni's hobbies include going to Skillet concerts, playing computer games, and wearing blue shirts to the shower. One cool and unusual fact about him is that he is one of five out of eleven members of the club to have a first name that begins with the letter A.");
User::createNewUser('hilsherc1', 'password','carter','hilsher',"One of the eight original founding fathers of the HTBC, Hilsher is known 
for his lavish lifestyle and admiration of the late great Jimmy Buffet. A sophomore at NKU, he majors in 
Rick and Morty. Out of eleven current members, Carter is the only one who does not live in the great blue
state of Kentucky (cue Drill Sergeant Roy yelling about his red headed step child). He can often be found 
spending his time working late nights at Skyline and talking people out of killing themselves at iHop. He 
has many hobbies ranging from chocolate cigars to sipping margaritas poolside to hailing Hitler in 
public. An interesting fact about Hilsher is that he is the son of Jody, who was the legendary athletic
director of a certain high school before a certain stoner took over the job and it all went to s***.");
User::createNewUser('schwiegera1', 'password','alex','schwiegeraht',"Alex is one of our eight founding fathers and perhaps the most influential contributor to the HTBC. 
Not only did he become the first presidente upon the club's establishment, not only did he help create
the sacred documents, and not only is he the brains responsible for this website, but he is also the 
owner of the HTBC's very own groupme chat. He also takes care a lot of the planning of both official 
HTBC meetings and casual group meetings outside of the hot tub. Right now, Schwiegeraht is a junior 
at NKU and majors in computer hacking (it is rumored that he allegedly helped Ethan Miles hack Calvary 
back in '012.) He also works at Amazon, where he is often spotted knife handing his subordinates and 
calling them his 'favorites.' Some of his hobbies include visiting Disney numerous times throughout 
the school year, eating at Tendy Town, and embracing his inner dad by wearing dad clothes, growing 
out a dad beard, and working on his dad bod.");
User::createNewUser('lozzie1', 'password','elias','lozzi',"Regarded as the most controversial and outspoken member of the HTBC, Lozzi is one of the club's 
eight founding members. He is currently a freshman at NKU, where he takes two classes (one of which 
he is repeating from last semester.) His major is currently unknown as he has claimed multiple majors 
including business, criminal justice, and culinary arts. Despite his school history, he has a decorated 
resume. He worked at Kroger along with the popular NKY rapper Lil9 for over a year and is currently 
selling real estate. Elias is a very eccentric man and that is shown in his favorite pastimes, which 
include excessively purchasing new video-games only to play them for a four hours, marking his body 
with crude and vile images including Satan himself, repeatedly sending dumb memes into the HTBC 
groupme, and proudly shouting some of the most politically incorrect, vulgar, insensitive, offensive, 
and profane words and phrases imaginable for no reason.");
User::createNewUser('hogartha1', 'password','andrew','hogarth',"Andrew is yet another one of our eight founding members and is one of the HTBC's key contributors.
Currently a sophomore at NKU, Mr. Hogarth majors in minors. He has had various occupations over the 
years, including being a middle-school swim coach and working for  world-renowned janitor Wally 
'Ulysses' Whanger as a part of his maintenance crew. In his free time Hogarth can most likely be found
taking out the trash, eating paper, hanging out with Popper at their condo, and randomly posting the 
most hilarious and savage of memes into the HTBC groupme. He is also known for having a very peculiar 
sense of fashion. He is almost never seen without his famous Calvary Cougars baseball cap while on the 
other hand, he has a habit of wearing full suits whenever he goes to the movies. Something interesting 
about Andrew is that he is the subject of Public Enemy #1's obsession and often has to duck out of 
unofficial HTBC lunch meetings so that he can hide");
User::createNewUser('popperm1', 'password','michael','popper',"Popper is one of our eight founding fathers, as well as one of the co-creators of the official HTBC 
documents. He is the son of local legend Chris Popper, who is known all around the Greater Cincinnati
area by a different name-Daddy. Michael currently attends NKU and majors in Asian chicks. Although he
has no known occupation, he owns a condo with fellow member Andrew 'Hoages' Hogarth and lives lavishly, 
often known for having steak and wine dinners. Some of his hobbies include making subtly politically 
incorrect statements (as opposed to Yogi's often bold and random phrases), showing off by doing pull-ups
at the top of Trump's wall, being a strong advocate of 'yellow fever', and visiting Daddy on the 
weekends. An unusual and interesting fact about Mr. Popper is that his beliefs and ideas actually 
inspired well-known Chinese dictator and communist Mao Zendong, who went on to kill 45 million people.");
