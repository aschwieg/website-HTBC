He is a sophomore at NKU and majors in wearing blue shirts to the pool. He once won the election for HTBC\'s \'El Presidente\', although his victory was controversial as he voted for himself and rival candidate Cody Howard did not. However, Baldoni randomly resigned his position, which is now vacant. In his free time, Anthony can be found working at Wendy\'s. Often times, his Wendy\'s is frequented by fellow HTBC members, who troll him by ordering meals under his middle name \'Santino.\' Baldoni\'s hobbies include going to Skillet concerts, playing computer games, and wearing blue shirts to the shower. One cool and unusual fact about him is that he is one of five out of eleven members of the club to have a first name that begins with the letter A.','a');

A sophomore at NKU, he majors in \r\nRick and Morty. Out of eleven current members, Carter is the only one who does not live in the great blue\r\nstate of Kentucky (cue Drill Sergeant Roy yelling about his red headed step child). He can often be found \r\nspending his time working late nights at Skyline and talking people out of killing themselves at iHop. He \r\nhas many hobbies ranging from chocolate cigars to sipping margaritas poolside to hailing Hitler in \r\npublic. An interesting fact about Hilsher is that he is the son of Jody, who was the legendary athletic\r\ndirector of a certain high school before a certain stoner took over the job and it all went to s***.','a');

He also takes care a lot of the planning of both official \r\nHTBC meetings and casual group meetings outside of the hot tub. Right now, Schwiegeraht is a junior \r\nat NKU and majors in computer hacking (it is rumored that he allegedly helped Ethan Miles hack Calvary \r\nback in \'012.) He also works at Amazon, where he is often spotted knife handing his subordinates and \r\ncalling them his \'favorites.\' Some of his hobbies include visiting Disney numerous times throughout \r\nthe school year, eating at Tendy Town, and embracing his inner dad by wearing dad clothes, growing \r\nout a dad beard, and working on his dad bod.','a');

He is currently a freshman at NKU, where he takes two classes (one of which \r\nhe is repeating from last semester.) His major is currently unknown as he has claimed multiple majors \r\nincluding business, criminal justice, and culinary arts. Despite his school history, he has a decorated \r\nresume. He worked at Kroger along with the popular NKY rapper Lil9 for over a year and is currently \r\nselling real estate. Elias is a very eccentric man and that is shown in his favorite pastimes, which \r\ninclude excessively purchasing new video-games only to play them for a four hours, marking his body \r\nwith crude and vile images including Satan himself, repeatedly sending dumb memes into the HTBC \r\ngroupme, and proudly shouting some of the most politically incorrect, vulgar, insensitive, offensive, \r\nand profane words and phrases imaginable for no reason.','a');

He has had various occupations over the \r\nyears, including being a middle-school swim coach and working for  world-renowned janitor Wally \r\n\'Ulysses\' Whanger as a part of his maintenance crew. In his free time Hogarth can most likely be found\r\ntaking out the trash, eating paper, hanging out with Popper at their condo, and randomly posting the \r\nmost hilarious and savage of memes into the HTBC groupme. He is also known for having a very peculiar \r\nsense of fashion. He is almost never seen without his famous Calvary Cougars baseball cap while on the \r\nother hand, he has a habit of wearing full suits whenever he goes to the movies. Something interesting \r\nabout Andrew is that he is the subject of Public Enemy #1\'s obsession and often has to duck out of \r\nunofficial HTBC lunch meetings so that he can hide','a');

Bethany attends NKU and majors in making up fake boyfriends to throw off sketchy desperate guys names John.

Bethany’s hobbies include dancing, talking about dancing, and day drinking.

She is the HTBC’s current president, despite the fact that not only is she in her second semester (as part of the clan), she also is not even an NKU student to begin with. Enrolled at the distant university of Xavier in the far reaches of Ohio, Hannah majors in showing up fashionably late to each and every HTBC session she attends. Her hobbies include eating at legendary restaurant “bootledings”, chilling in the All for One shop, and dating Army guys. A very interesting and little known fact about her is that she is an exceptional and enthusiastic D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) player. Her enthusiasm for the game is so extreme, in fact, that she has even gone as far as to fill in role-playing the parts of the NPCs (non-playable characters.)','a');
